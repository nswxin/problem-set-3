## Subset Selection

### Generate Data

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
beta <- runif(20,-1,1)
beta[c(3,8,17)] <- 0
predictors <- matrix(data = runif(200000,0,1),nrow = 1000, ncol = 20)
y <- predictors %*% beta + rnorm(1000,0,1)
data <- data.frame(predictors,y)
```

### 

```{r}
set.seed(2234)
split <- initial_split(data,0.1)
train <- training(split)
test <- testing(split)
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
